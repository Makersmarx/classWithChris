## Simple idea that will eventually allow users to share learning content.

Currently the idea is to hook up the google books API so that a user can find content for extended learning. I am practicing with various front end approaches and hope to expand on this further as I have time. Need to add responsive design

Made with HTML, Sass, Bootstrap, JS, & some Jquery
